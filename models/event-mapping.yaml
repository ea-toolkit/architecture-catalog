# Event Catalog View Mapping
# Maps registry element types to semantic event-flow roles.
# This file is OPTIONAL — if absent, no Events tab appears.
#
# Values are element type KEYS from registry-mapping.yaml.
# The loader auto-traverses intermediate hops (e.g. event → API → subsystem)
# so you don't need to configure the chain explicitly.

service_type: software_subsystem

# Optional display label overrides (defaults to type label from registry-mapping.yaml):
# service_label: Service
# event_label: Domain Event
