## Why Architecture Catalog?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Schema-driven" icon="setting">
    One YAML file defines everything: element types, fields, relationships, layers, and branding. Zero hardcoded type names in the UI.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Plain Markdown" icon="document">
    Each architecture element is a `.md` file with YAML frontmatter. No proprietary formats, no vendor lock-in. Git-friendly and AI-readable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Static site" icon="rocket">
    Builds to pure static HTML with Astro. Deploy anywhere: GitHub Pages, S3, Netlify, or behind your VPN. No servers, no databases.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Interactive graphs" icon="random">
    Dependency graphs powered by React Flow with automatic dagre layout. Search, filter, export to PNG.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
